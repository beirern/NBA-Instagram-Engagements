ML for predicting NBA Instagram Engagements

## Wait, what is this one?
In the summer of 2019 I applied with some friends to the NBA Hackathon.
One of the prompts was to predict Instagram engagements based off of the description,
engagements, followers, and the time of each post. At the time (summer 2019) we had 0 ML
knowledge and we failed, don't worry though, we got the other prompt ([NBA Offensive & Defensive Ratings repo](https://github.com/beirern/NBA-Play-By-Play-to-Offensive-Defensive-Ratings))!
But now that I have taken a ML class I retried the prompt and this is the work.
They gave us a `training_set.csv` which is for training and `holdout_set.csv` which is used to predict final engagements.

**Warning:** I have put **ALL** my work here so please do not run all the cells. The work involves a lot of different methods to see which one would work better. Running all cells would take forever. All the output is there so there's no big reason to run anyway.
